Changing Marital Status : When trying to submit a change in marital status,  a red error appears saying 'change to marital status requires evidence'. Can we remove any requirements in relation to such documentation?

"ADDITIONAL COMMENTS - Hi all, 

with reference to ticket RITM8238460 we’d like to ask if you could design a validation (hard stop with an error note) that would prevent workers from adding/changing their work phone details. Below you'll find all necessary information.

Thanks in advance and best regards
Alina

1. What is the business case / justification for the changes being requested?
a) We have an automatic webservice providing business phones numbers from our SAP directory into Workday directly , hence no need for manual updates by the worker and
b) We’ve seen several cases in which employees used the work contact details to provide their private phone numbers as well which is against GDPR regulations.

2. Is the change legally required? If so, you will need to provide legal documentation to support the legal requirement (e.g. email from local OGC, legislation etc.)

> There should be no possibility for a worker to provide personal data which isn’t required by process or business need. (principal of data minimisation / GDPR)
Legal requirement:
“1 lit. c GDPR: ""Personal data must be appropriate and relevant to the purpose and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of processing (""data minimization""). Data economy and data minimization are therefore closely related to the earmarking of data.”

3. What are the risks / impacts if changes aren't approved?

> Holding false or unnecessary personal data within our leading HC system which is not in alignment with GDPR regulatories. 

4. Do you need this validation to be implemented for both employees and contingent workers? Meaning, the validation saying it is not possible to add/change work phone would appear for both worker types.

> The validation should be implemented for employees and contingent workers.

5. Do you wish to implement a validation for 'Primary Work Phone' and 'Additional Work Phone' or only for one of the fields?

> We’d like to have the validation for both fields ('Primary Work Phone' and 'Additional Work Phone')."	,	HCM

Hope you are well. 

We would like to add around 200 active contractors to WD, without triggering the IT process (email, GUID and laptop issuance). Those contractors are active and joined PWC either recently or less than a year ago. 
Please note that the number is increasing, we are receiving such cases on a weekly basis and we need to start accounting for them in WD.

Could you please advise what is the best process considering we do not want IT things to be triggered?

"ADDITIONAL COMMENTS - Hi Team,

Hope you are well. We would like to implement the Notice Period step in the Hire process. We would like it to be set up in the same way as 'Manage Probation Period' step. It means that the value (Notice Period) should be default wherever it is possible (ME has 12 countries and some countries have the rules for notice period, but some of them don't and the value can be different for every employee) but it should not be automatic complete. It should work in the same way as 'Manage Probation Period"" step meaning it should go to Recruiters, they can fill it in and submit.

Is it something you can help with please?

Please verify the Workday ID for each badge to see if the same values remain. Due to the pwc14 refresh this weekend, there may be 2 certifications that need to be reconfigured in pwc14 (as it appears they do not currently exist in prod). I have highlighted those in yellow. This request can wait until next week to avoid any issues with the pwc14 refresh this weekend.

"ADDITIONAL COMMENTS - Good day,
We would like to include 3 staff members into the Calibration. How do I need to proceed?
It concerns Charlotte Mas (101099688), Hassiba Ait Dani (101101962) and Jérémy Chiffele (101107060).
Do I start the Annual Performance Review, then manually advance the self-evaluation, then manually advance the manager evaluation and then you have the possibility to include them in the Calibration flag? Or what would be the procedure. 
In the QRC 27 (page 5) that there is the possibility to use the manage calibration possibility. Unfortunately, I do not understand if this is the task to do. If it's the correct one, I kindly ask you to send me instructions as there is no result when I look for this task in Workday.
